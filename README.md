## 🧠 About Me

- I turn messy data into neat plots, then pretend it was easy.  
- I write Python like it owes me money.  
- I read the GDPR so you don’t have to. No, you still should.  
- Favorite debugging strategy: talk to the rubber duck, sacrifice the cache.  
- Motto: *Trust the process. Monitor the process. Roll back the process.*

## 📊 Stats, Graphs, and Other Rituals

- I push code often enough to confuse the contribution graph.  
- I delete code often enough to confuse myself.
